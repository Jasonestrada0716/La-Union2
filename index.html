         <p>A 400-year-old watchtower facing the West Philippine Sea built during the Spanish period, a 5.6-meter high made by reddish bricks structure located at Barangay Victoria, Municipality of Luna. Spaniards created the tower as a lookout point for the approaching attacks of Japanese, Chinese and Moro pirates and other conquerors in the coastal towns of La Union.

            <h2>Tangadan Falls</h2>
            <p>At the mountainous part of San Gabriel, La Union, one of the indigenous town located at the western part of the province, lies the majestic TANGADAN FALLS. Majestic as it seems since it is analogically compared to a masterpiece that was magically turned into a reality. The spot is definitely an epitome of perfection because even at this moment that its ambiance already possesses a bit of modernity, one can still feel Mother nature’s touch that could calm senses, cleanse souls, heals broken hearts and paves way to the realization of God’s amazing and wonderful creation.

            <h2>Tuddingan Falls</h2>
            <p>The Province of La Union is blessed with majestic waterfalls because of the continued protection of trees in its mountains that help keep our bodies of water flourish, constantly nurturing Mother Nature all year round, and an example of which is the enchanting Tuddingan Falls in the Municipality of Naguilian.  Unlike other waterfalls in the province which have poor accessibility, visitors have the luxury of walking on a 700-meter cemented pathway with grills beside Bagulin Road up to the hill overlooking the waterfall, which has become a priceless treasure of La Union’s Basi capital.  According to the friendly village chief, the sources of Tuddingan Falls are the numerous water springs in the mountains which also supply the vast riceland of Naguilian.  All year round, Tuddingan promises a fantastic view, showcasing clean and strong water.  This towering beauty of about 70 feet has a man-made pool-like base which makes it more tempting to swimmers, especially for those who love to make daring dives by jumping from its perfectly formed multi-layered rock strata.  Tuddingan Falls was the venue of the 2004 Global Reunion of Naguilian, where the balikbayan's homesick feeling was instantly quenched by the charming waterfall.

               <h2>San Juan</h2>
               <p>San Juan has been making waves lately as a hip surfing destination in Northern Luzon. Its proximity to Manila makes it a popular weekend getaway, especially for people looking to do a little more than lay around on a beach.
                I’ve been hearing the buzz about San Juan for several years now but it wasn’t until it started emerging as a foodie destination did I start becoming seriously interested in it. And I’m not alone either.
                More and more people like me, who weren’t as interested in surfing, are being lured by the promise of good food and making the 5-7 drive to San Juan to give it a go.
                If you’re one of those people, then I hope this first-timer’s La Union travel guide can help you plan your trip. It focuses mainly on the surfing town of San Juan, but there are a few points of interest in neighboring La Union towns as well.

               <h2>Immuki Island</h2>
               <p>Everyone’s looking forward to traveling after the pandemic. For big city dwellers, the sea is surely at the top of post-COVID travel bucket lists. Instead of going to your usual beach spots once travel restrictions are lifted, we suggest that you visit the Insta-worthy Immuki Island in Balaoan, La Union. 
                While the place is called an island, it’s actually a bunch of coral rock formations. Between these are mini lagoons that can serve as your private pool if there aren’t many other tourists around. Plus, the waters here are clear and refreshing. The fantasy-esque scenery is sure to make your mermaid or merman dreams come true.

            <p>Looking for something unusual in the province here in La Union you can find a place where you can meditate and be a religously devotee even just for a while. Try visiting the Ma Cho temple, the very first Taoist temple in the country and one of the biggest temple outside of China. It is located on a hill downtown San Fernando and over-looking the south China sea, a perfect location for the so called “Goddess of the Sea” and “Queen of Heaven”. it was built by the Tourism Minister Jose D. Aspiras, with the cooperation of the Chinese community in the Philippines. It stands majestically on a more than one hectare of lot, seven-storey high and an elevation of 70 feet above sea level.
