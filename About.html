A Brief Histor


The province was created on March 2, 1850, out of towns then belonging to Ilcos Sur and Pangasinan.

Luciano Almeda headed the provincial government for the time during the Philippine Revolution, while General Manuel Tinio occupied San Fernando in May 1898. After the battle on November 19, 1899, the American troops took control of the province.

In 1901, a civil government was established in La Union. A year later, La Union ceded a narrow strip of land to Amburayan, which later became a sub-province of the old Mountain Province.
